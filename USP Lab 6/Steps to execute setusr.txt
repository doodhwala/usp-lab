Steps:

Create two users who belong to two different groups.

user1:

Create file test.dat, write few lines (from command prompt)
user1 is owner of file test.dat permissions rw-rw-r

Compile file setusr.c
Executable file created : a.out

./a.out
On execution, user1 appends "hello" to file contents.

Switch user (user2)

sudo su user2
Navigate to directory where setusr.c and test.dat is present.

Execute a.out
./a.out
open:Permission denied
(Because user2 doesn't have permission to write to file test.dat)

Now switch back to user1
su user1
Set set uid bit for executable file a.out
(Any user who executes a.out will get temporary permissions of user1 on files opened)
chmod u+s a.out

Switch to user2

sudo su user2
Now execute a.out
./a.out
No error. User2 can append to file test.dat, because it will have temporary permissions of user1 on test.dat
