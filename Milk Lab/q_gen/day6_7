1. experiment:
	a) write the string "I am a fool" to the file descriptor 1
	b) write the string "I am a fool" to the file descriptor 0
	c) read into a char array the string stupid from the file descriptor 0
	d) read into a char array the string stupid from the file descriptor 1
	e) seek to the offset 10000 from the beginning file on the file descriptor 1

2. A directory has # of text files. 
   a) Combine all of them to create a single file. (like the tar utility)
   b) break the combined files back to the constituent files. (like the untar utility)

3. Experiment with set user bit.
   Create two users(same rama and krishna).
   rama creates a file junk.txt with permissions rw-------.
   rama creates an executable program to append the string "adding a line" to the file junk.txt.
   Let krishna login and check whether he can append.
   rama changes the permission on the executable program and adds set user bit.
   Let krishna try again. check what happens to the file junk.txt.

4. Open a file for reading in a program. As the program is still executing, move the file
   to a different name and/or different directory in the same file system. Can you read the 
   file further in the program? Experiment and check.

5. Open a file for reading in a program. Remove the file from the directory. Confirm that 
   the filename no more exists using ls command. Can you read the file further in the program?
